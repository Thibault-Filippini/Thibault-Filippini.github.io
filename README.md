# Thibault Filippini

## About Me

I graduated in **Applied Computer Science** at PXL, specializing in Software Management, and in **Information Management** from KU Leuven (June 2023). Currently, I work as a **Data Consultant** at Acumen.

## Interests

### Sports 🏃
I have a deep passion for sports, particularly **kickboxing**, **snowboarding**, and **triathlon**. As a former member of the PXL rowing team, I trained five times a week, constantly pushing my limits. I participated in my first official triathlon sprints in **September 2017** and **2018**. I live by the motto: *"One finds limits by pushing them."*

### Wine 🍷
Wine is my second great passion. I am currently studying for the **WSET Level 4 Diploma** at the Weinakademie in Rust. I enjoy attending tastings and wine trips and regularly host wine tastings. Feel free to contact me if you're interested in attending or organizing a tasting!

### Music 🎶
In my free time, I love listening to music, attending festivals, and playing the **piano**. Music has been a hobby of mine for several years, and it's a way to balance my other interests.

## Personal Approach
I am spontaneous and intuitive in decision-making, adapting to my environment. My focus is on achieving results, with a flexible, goal-oriented approach. Collaboration is a strength, and while I enjoy being part of a team, I also take responsibility when needed.
